<p>Suppose the prevalence of a disease in the general population is 4%.
In this population, lives a group of individuals who have all been
exposed to air pollution. Concerned about their health, we decide to
embark on a quest to uncover whether being exposed to air pollution
influenced the risk of contracting this disease.</p>

<p>The prevalence of the disease within test group exposed to air

<p>We assemble a group of 100 individuals who have been exposed to air
pollution (test group) from the population and each individual is
carefully examined, checking for any signs of the disease. Out of the
100 individuals, we discover that 9 of them were indeed suffering from
the disease, so the <em>observed</em> proportion is 9%. This is
different from 4%, but we are not satisfied with just this knowledge,
since the observed difference in proportions could be due to chance. We
want to know if this prevalence of the disease within the group exposed
to air pollution was significantly different from the population’s
average, meaning that it’s very unlikely to observe this difference just
by chance. So, we decide to perform binomial test (please refer back to
binomial tests tutorial) <a href="%22https://sarahkaspar.github.io/biostatistics-course/03-binomial.html%22" class="external-link">The
binomial distribution</a>. With this test, we could compare the observed
prevalence within our group that has been exposed to air pollution to
the known prevalence in the entire population.</p>
<p>We set our significance level (α) beforehand, typically at 0.05, to
determine whether the results are statistically significant.</p>

<p>The P-value we get, is the probability of obtaining extreme outcome,
assuming that the null hypothesis is true. Therefore, the binomial test
calculates the probability of observing the obtained (9 persons with a
disease) or more extreme results assuming the null hypothesis is true.
If this probability is sufficiently low (below our chosen significance
level), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative
hypothesis.</p>
<p>The binomial test result (~0.012) reveals that the prevalence of the
disease among the individuals exposed to air pollution was indeed
significantly different from that of the population.</p>

</h2>
<p>Conducting a single study might not provide conclusive evidence due
to various factors such as sample variability, random chance, and other
unknown influences.</p>
<p>We decide to investigate the potential impact of air pollution on
disease prevalence in 200 various locations. We want to assess whether
there is a significant difference in disease rates between groups
exposed to air pollution and the average for the whole population.</p>
<p>We want to know how hypothesis testing works, when we perform it
simultaneously or in quick succession on many tests.</p>
<p>We therefore decide to simulate the scenario where we conduct 200
tests, each with a 5% chance (alpha = 0.05) of producing a significant
result (i.e., a p-value less than 0.05) even when the null hypothesis is
true.</p>
<p>Our null hypothesis in each location is that there is no real
difference in disease rates between the groups exposed to air pollution
and the average for the whole population.</p>

tested for a disease. The disease prevalence is 0.04. The experiment is
repeated 200 times</div>
</figure><p>To do this, we write a program in R, which simulates study results
when the prevalence in the test group is 4% (null hypothesis is true).
We run these experiments to see what would happen if we kept doing tests
even when there was not actually any difference.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/What%20is%20multiple%20testing-rendered-Simulating%20200%20test%20groups-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>We are interested in determining if the observed proportion
significantly deviates from the expected proportion (0.4) in either
direction (either higher or lower). As this is a two-tailed binomial
test, we needed to adjust the bounds for what is considered
“significant” based on the significance level of 0.05. We are interested
in the extreme tails of the distribution that contain 2.5% of the data
on each side.</p>
<p>We therefore use <code>qbinom()</code> function in this simulation to
calculate the quantiles of the binomial distribution corresponding to
the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. This gives us the bounds that would
contain 95% of the data under the null hypothesis. We then classify a
group as “significant” if the observed number of patients falls below
the 2.5th percentile or above the 97.5th percentile of the binomial
distribution.</p>
<p>In the resulting histogram, we find that even in a world where there
was no true difference in disease prevalence, about 5% of our simulated
experiments yielded statistically significant results purely by chance
(the red bars).</p>
<p>It is important to note that the significance level (α) that we
choose for each individual test directly impacts the rate of false
positives. This is basically the <strong>Comparison-Wise Error Rate
(CWER)</strong>, the probability of making a Type I error (false
positive) in a single hypothesis test. In our example, we have set
α=0.05 for each individual test, which means we are essentially saying
that we are willing to accept a 5% chance of making a false positive
error for each test, and this means that for 100 tests, we expect about
5 false positives.</p>
<p>By running this simulation multiple times, we can observe how often
we get false positive results when there should be none. This helps us
understand the likelihood of obtaining a significant result purely by
chance, even if there is no true effect or difference.</p>

<p>Multiple testing refers to the practice of conducting numerous
hypothesis tests simultaneously or repeatedly on the same data set. It
is typically motivated by the desire to explore different aspects of the
data or to investigate multiple hypotheses. Researchers employ multiple
tests to examine various relationships, comparisons, or associations
within their dataset, such as comparing means, proportions,
correlations, or other statistical analyses that involve hypothesis
testing.</p>

<h1 id="types-of-errors">Types of errors<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#types-of-errors"></a>
</h1>
<p>In hypothesis testing, the evaluation of statistical significance
involves making decisions based on sample data. However, these decisions
are not without errors. In this tutorial, we will explore the concept of
errors in hypothesis testing (Type I and Type II errors), and their
implications.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="type-i-error">Type I Error<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#type-i-error"></a>
</h2>
<p>Type I error occurs when we reject a null hypothesis that is actually
true. For example, in our previous example where we conducted many
similar experiments, we experienced type I error by concluding that
exposure to air pollution has an effect on disease prevalence (rejecting
the null hypothesis) when it actually has no effect. Type I errors
represent false positives and can lead to incorrect conclusions,
potentially resulting in wasted resources or misguided decisions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="type-ii-error">Type II Error<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#type-ii-error"></a>
</h2>
<p>Type II error occurs when we fail to reject a null hypothesis that is
actually false. For example, when we fail to conclude that exposure to
air pollution has an effect on disease prevalence (failing to reject the
null hypothesis) when it actually has a positive effect. Type II errors
represent false negatives and can result in missed opportunities or
overlooking significant effects.</p>
<p>One common way when this error occurs in the context of hypothesis
testing, is when a method with low <strong>statistical power</strong> is
chosen (if the sample size is small or the effect size (difference in
disease prevalence) is small). Statistical power refers to the
probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is indeed
false. In simpler terms, it measures the likelihood of detecting a true
effect or difference if it exists. A test with high power is more likely
to detect a real effect, while a test with low power is more likely to
miss detecting a real effect, leading to a Type II error (false
negative).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="confusion-matrix">Confusion Matrix<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#confusion-matrix"></a>
</h2>
<p>In the context of hypothesis testing, we can conceptualize Type I and
Type II errors using a confusion matrix. The confusion matrix represents
the outcomes of hypothesis testing as True Positives (correctly
rejecting H0), False Positives (incorrectly rejecting H0), True
Negatives (correctly failing to reject H0), and False Negatives
(incorrectly failing to reject H0).</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/Figure%201%20Errors%20in%20hypothesis%20testing.png" alt="Figure_4: Errors in hypothesis testing and how they arise" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Figure_4: Errors in hypothesis testing and how
they arise</div>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level1">
<h1 id="the-problem">The problem<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-problem"></a>
</h1>
<p>In hypothesis testing, the occurrence of Type I and Type II errors
can have different implications depending on the context of the problem
being addressed. It is crucial to understand which errors are
problematic in which situation to be able to make informed decisions and
draw accurate conclusions from statistical analyses.</p>
<p>Type I errors, are particularly problematic in situations where the
cost or consequences of incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis are
high. Again if we refer back to our example, if we incorrectly conclude
that there is a significant difference in disease rates between the test
groups exposed to air pollution and the average for the whole population
when, in fact, there is no such difference, it could lead to misguided
policies or interventions targeting air pollution reduction. For
instance, authorities might implement costly environmental regulations
or public health measures based on erroneous conclusions. In this case,
the <strong>consequences</strong> include misallocation of resources,
leading to unnecessary financial burdens or societal disruptions.
Moreover, public trust in scientific findings and policy decisions may
be eroded if false positives lead to ineffective or burdensome
interventions.</p>
<p>Type II errors, are problematic when failing to detect a significant
effect has substantial consequences.If we fail to detect a significant
difference in disease rates between the test group and the population
average when there actually is a difference due to air pollution
exposure, it could result in overlooking a serious public health
concern. In this case, individuals living in polluted areas may continue
to suffer adverse health effects without receiving appropriate attention
or interventions. The <strong>consequences</strong> include increased
morbidity and mortality rates among populations exposed to high levels
of air pollution. Additionally, delayed or inadequate response to
environmental health risks may exacerbate inequalities in health
outcomes.</p>

<h2 id="the-example-of-cancer-screening">The example of cancer screening<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-example-of-cancer-screening"></a>
</h2>
<p>Cancer screening exemplifies a medical testing paradox, where the
interpretation of test results can be influenced by factors such as
disease prevalence, test sensitivity, and specificity.</p>
<p>Let us say that in a sample of 1000 women, 1% (10) have cancer, while
the remaining 99% (990) do not have cancer. This gives us the prevalence
of a disease. However, after testing, the test results show that out of
the 10 women with cancer, 9 receive a <strong>true positive</strong>
result (correctly identified as positive), and 1 receives a
<strong>false negative</strong> result (incorrectly identified as
negative). False negatives can delay the diagnosis and treatment of
cancer, allowing the disease to progress unchecked and potentially
reducing the effectiveness of treatment options. This can result in
poorer outcomes and decreased survival rates for patients. In addition,
out of the 990 women without cancer, 89 receive <strong>false
positive</strong> results (incorrectly identified as positive), and 901
receive <strong>true negative</strong> results (correctly identified as
negative). False positive can lead to unnecessary follow-up tests,
procedures, and treatments for individuals who do not have cancer. It
can cause anxiety, physical discomfort, and financial burden for
patients, as well as strain on healthcare resources.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/cancer%20paradox.png" alt="Figure_5: A tree diagram describing the outcomes of a breast cancer test" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Figure_5: A tree diagram describing the outcomes
of a breast cancer test</div>
</figure><p>We could interpret that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>probability</strong> that a woman who receives a
positive result actually has cancer is ≈ 1/10 ( 9/ (9 + 89)). This is
the positive predictive value (PPV) of the test.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>sensitivity</strong> of the test, which measures its
ability to detect the presence of disease is 90% (9/10 * 100). This
means that the false negative rate of the test is 10%.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>specificity</strong> of the test, which measures its
ability to correctly identify individuals without the disease is ≈ 91%
(901/990 * 100). Here, the false positive rate of the test is
9%.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While the test may have high accuracy in terms of sensitivity and
specificity, the positive predictive value is relatively low due to the
low prevalence of the disease in the population. This means that a
positive result from the test does not strongly predict the presence of
the disease in an individual. Similarly, false positives and false
negatives can affect the negative predictive value of the test, which
measures its ability to correctly identify individuals who do not have
cancer. False negatives decrease the negative predictive value, while
false positives increase it, potentially leading to misinterpretation of
test results.</p>
<p>This example underscores the complexity of interpreting medical test
results and emphasizes the need to consider factors such as disease
prevalence, test sensitivity, and specificity in clinical
decision-making. Increasing sensitivity may reduce false negatives but
can also increase false positives, and vice versa. Thus, optimizing the
trade-off between sensitivity and specificity is crucial to minimize
false positives and false negatives while maximizing the accuracy of the
screening test.</p>

<p>In many real-world scenarios, there is a trade-off between Type I and
Type II errors, and the appropriate balance depends on the specific
goals and constraints of the problem. Reseachers may prioritize one over
the other based on the severity of the consequences. For example, in
cancer screenings, minimizing false negatives (Type II errors) is
typically prioritized to avoid missing potential cases of cancer, even
if it leads to an increase in false positives (Type I errors).</p>
<p>Effective evaluation of Type I and Type II errors necessitates a
comprehensive consideration of the associated costs, risks, and ethical
implications. This holistic approach enhances the validity and
reliability of research findings by ensuring that decisions regarding
hypothesis acceptance or rejection are informed not only by statistical
significance but also by the potential real-world consequences of both
false positives and false negatives. By carefully weighing these
factors, researchers can make informed decisions that minimize the
likelihood of erroneous conclusions while maximizing the practical
relevance and ethical soundness of their findings.</p>

<p>In statistical hypothesis testing, conducting multiple tests

error rate (FWER), and discuss methods to account for multiple
comparisons, using practical examples.</p>

<p>In multiple testing scenarios, we often have an overarching
hypothesis that encompasses several individual hypotheses, each
examining specific aspects or relationships within the data. This
approach allows us to explore various facets of the research question
comprehensively.</p>
<p>Going back to our study investigating the effects of air pollution on
the prevalence of a disease, the overarching hypothesis could be
formulated as follows:</p>
<p><em>Exposure to air pollution is associated with increased prevalence
of the disease</em></p>
<p>Under this overarching hypothesis, several individual hypotheses can
be formulated to examine different aspects of the relationship between
air pollution exposure and disease prevalence. These individual
hypotheses may focus on various pollutants, different health outcomes,
or specific populations.</p>
<p>An example using three individual null hypotheses:</p>
<p><strong><span class="math inline">\(H_{0,1}\)</span></strong>:
Exposure to particulate matter is not associated with increased disease
prevalence.</p>
<p><strong><span class="math inline">\(H_{0,2}\)</span></strong>:
Exposure to nitrogen dioxide is not associated with increased disease
prevalence.</p>
<p><strong><span class="math inline">\(H_{0,3}\)</span></strong>:
Long-term exposure to ozone (O3) is not associated with an increased
prevalence of the disease.</p>
<p>The three null hypotheses can be combined to the following overall
null hypothesis:</p>
<p><strong><span class="math inline">\(H_{0}\)</span></strong>: Air
pollution is not associated with an increased prevalence of the
disease.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>As soon as one of the individual null hypotheses is rejected, we also
reject the overall null hypothesis. Rejecting the overall null
hypothesis would mean that at least one of the individual null
hypotheses is false. Therefore, we will want to make sure that we have
not a single false positive among our individual hypothesis tests.</p>

</figure><p>In this illustration, each individual hypothesis delves into a
distinct facet of the overarching research inquiry, enabling us to
thoroughly examine the intricate connection between air pollution
exposure and disease prevalence. By scrutinizing the impacts of various
air pollutants on the disease, this method encourages a systematic
exploration of diverse factors and aids in revealing potential
associations or patterns within the data set.</p>
<p>Now, let us assume that after data collection, for hypothesis 1, we
find that 15 out of 100 individuals exposed to high levels of
particulate matter develop the disease, for hypothesis 2, 20 out of 100
individuals exposed to high levels of nitrogen dioxide develop the
disease and for hypothesis 3, 5 out of 100 individuals exposed to high
levels of ozone develop the disease.</p>
<p>Let us assume we conduct statistical tests for each of these
hypotheses, resulting in p-values for each test. For simplicity, let us
maintain our significance level at <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.05\)</span> for each individual test. We
can conduct binomial tests for each hypothesis and calculate the
p-values in R.</p>

the set of tests (also known as familywise error rate or FWER), we can
use methods such as the Bonferroni correction. This method adjust the

<p>Since in our example above we have three tests (three hypotheses),
the Bonferroni corrected significance level is <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{\text{bonf}} = 0.05/3 \approx
0.0167\)</span>.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="interpretation">Interpretation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#interpretation"></a>
</h4>
<p>For each individual test, we compare the calculated p-value to this
adjusted significance level. If the p-value is less than or equal to
0.0167, we reject the null hypothesis for that test.</p>
<p>Based on the Bonferroni correction, we reject the null hypothesis for
Hypotheses 1, indicating significant associations between particulate
matter with disease prevalence. However, for Hypothesis 2 (nitrogen
dioxide exposure) and 3 (ozone exposure), we fail to reject the null
hypothesis, suggesting no significant association with disease
prevalence at the adjusted significance level. This adjustment for
multiple testing helps control the overall probability of making at
least one false-positive error across all tests conducted.</p>
<p>In this example, while the evidence supports associations between
certain air pollutants and disease prevalence, it does not provide
conclusive evidence to reject the overarching null hypothesis entirely.
Instead, it suggests a nuanced interpretation wherein the relationship
between air pollution exposure and disease prevalence may vary depending
on the specific pollutant considered. Therefore, further investigation
and analysis may be necessary to fully elucidate the relationship
between air pollution exposure and disease prevalence and to refine the
overarching null hypothesis accordingly. This could involve exploring
additional factors, conducting more comprehensive analyses, or
considering alternative statistical approaches to account for potential
confounding variables or sources of variability in the data.</p>

</h1>
<p>In high-throughput experiments like RNA-Seq, we often conduct
thousands of statistical tests simultaneously. This large number of
tests increases the risk of false positives. While controlling the
family-wise error rate (FWER), the probability of making at least one
type I error, is one approach to address false positives, it can be too
conservative, leading to few or no significant results. An alternative
approach is to control the <strong>False Discovery Rate (FDR)</strong>,
the expected proportion of false positives among the rejected
hypotheses, which offers a balance between identifying true positives
and limiting false positives. In this tutorial, we will learn how each
method affects the outcome.</p>

<p>The Airway dataset contains gene expression data from a study

on airway smooth muscle cells. The dataset is part of the airway package
in Bioconductor, a project that provides tools for the analysis and
comprehension of high-throughput genomic data.</p>
<p>In differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis, thousands of
statistical tests (one for each gene) are conducted, which increases the
chance of false positives. Using the airway dataset, we can decide to
analyze DEGs between treated and untreated samples. Here, the null
hypothesis would state that there is no difference in gene expression
between the two groups ( dexamethasone treated and untreated). The

p-values for each gene, the data which, we are going use to see how

</h2>
<p>A p-value histogram is a graphical representation that displays the
distribution of p-values obtained from multiple hypothesis tests. When
conducting a large number of statistical tests, such as in genome-wide
association studies or RNA-Seq analysis, p-value histograms provide a
visual tool to assess the behavior and distribution of p-values across
all tests. This helps in assessing the presence of true effects versus
null effects and in understanding the overall behavior of the tests.</p>
<p>In hypothesis testing, a p-value represents the probability of
observing the test results, or more extreme results, given that the null
hypothesis is true. When performing multiple hypothesis tests, we obtain
a set of p-values, one for each test.</p>
<p>To create a p-value histogram, we plot the p-values on the x-axis,
typically ranging from 0 to 1. The y-axis represents the frequency (or
count) of p-values falling within specific bins (intervals) of the
x-axis.</p>

</h3>
<p>Decomposing a p-value histogram involves analyzing the distribution
of p-values to understand the underlying behavior of your hypothesis
tests. This process can help you identify whether your results are due
to true effects, random chance, or other factors.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/p_value%20histogram%20decomposition.png" alt="Figure_8: A p-value histogram decomposition" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Figure_8: A p-value histogram
decomposition</div>
</figure><p>in reference to <strong>figure 8</strong>, We think of the p-values
as coming from two components: The uniform component (the area in gray)
which comes from tests where the null hypothesis is true, and an
alternative component (the area in blue) which comes from tests where
the alternative is true. These tend to have lower p-values.</p>
<p>Say, we determine some cut-off p-value, indicated by the red line.
Then we can visually estimate what percentage of tests right at this
threshold are false positives, namely by dividing the length of the
light red segment by the overall length of the line. That’s the local
<strong>fdr</strong>, and it applies to tests rejected just at this
threshold. Now we will probably reject all the tests below the
threshold, and to get the fraction of false positives within those, we
divide the dark gray area by the the total area to the left of the red
line. This is the capital letter <strong>FDR</strong> and it’s an
average property of all tests rejected below the threshold.</p>
<p><img src="../fig/How%20p-value%20histogram%20relates%20to%20the%20confusion%20matrix.png" alt="Figure_8: How p-value histogram relates to the confusion matrix" class="figure">
We can visualize again the connection of the p-value histogram to the
confusion matrix. The four areas (dark blue, light blue, dark gray and
light gray) correspond to the fractions of True Positives, False
Negatives, False Positives and True Negatives, respectively, for the
p-value threshold indicated by the red line. in the sace of differential
expression of genes, if we set the threshold very low, we will have a
low FDR (low fraction of false positives), but will miss many of the
differentially expressed genes. When we move the red line to the right,
that is increase the threshold, we’ll capture more and more of the
differentially expressed genes, but at the cost of more and more false
positives, and if we go too far, we will almost exclusively admit more
False Positives.</p>

</h3>
<p>If all the null hypotheses are true (i.e., there is no effect),
p-values should follow a uniform distribution. This means the histogram
should show a relatively flat distribution of p-values across the range
from 0 to 1, with each bin having roughly the same height
(<strong>Figure 8</strong>).</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/null_pvalues.png" alt="Figure_8: How p-values would look like if most or all our hypotheses were null" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Figure_8: How p-values would look like if most
or all our hypotheses were null</div>
</figure><p>However, seeing this does not mean they actually are all null. It
means that at most a small percentage of hypotheses are non-null and
could be identified by a correction method. That is why applying an
uncorrected rule like “Accept everything with p-value less than 0.05” is
certain to give you many false discoveries.</p>
<p>If there are true effects present, you would expect to see an excess
of low p-values (close to 0) compared to what would be expected under a
uniform distribution (<strong>Figure 9</strong>). This indicates
potential significant findings. A large spike near zero can indicate
that many tests are finding significant results, suggesting the presence
of true positives.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/reg_pvalues.png" alt="Figure_9: A peak close to 0 is where our alternative hypotheses live- along with some potential false positives" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Figure_9: A peak close to 0 is where our
alternative hypotheses live- along with some potential false
positives</div>
</figure><p>A right-skewed distribution, with most p-values clustering towards 1
(<strong>Figure 10</strong>), might suggest that most tests are not
finding significant results, indicating that there may be few true
effects in the data.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/conservative_pvalues.png" alt="Figure_10: Conservative p-values, something is wrong with your test!" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Figure_10: Conservative p-values, something is
wrong with your test!</div>
</figure><p>P-values are designed to be uniform under the null hypothesis.
Therefore, if we observe deviations from this expectation, it should not
lead us to conclude that there are no significant hypotheses. Instead,
it suggests that there may be issues with our testing methodology. For
example, our test assumptions might not align with the actual data
distribution. It is possible that the test assumes a certain data
distribution (like continuous or normal), which doesn’t match the actual
characteristics of our data—such as it being discrete or highly
non-normal.</p>
<p>Some histogram like shown in <strong>Figure 11</strong> might exhibit
pronounced spikes at p-values near zero and near one.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/bimodal_pvalues.png" alt="Figure_11: Bimodal p-values" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Figure_11: Bimodal p-values</div>
</figure><p>This behavior often signals potential issues such as p-hacking or
deficiencies in experimental design. For instance, in the context of a
one-tailed test (e.g., assessing whether each gene increases expression
in response to a drug), p-values nearing 1 may indicate significance in
the opposite direction—instances where genes decreased their expression.
If you wish to identify such cases, consider switching to a two-sided
test. Alternatively, if these cases are irrelevant, filtering out
instances where estimates point in that direction could be
effective.</p>
<p>Moreover, in RNA-Seq data, for example, certain genes may show no
reads across all conditions, leading some differential expression tools
to return a p-value of 1. Identifying and filtering out such problematic
cases beforehand can help streamline our analysis without sacrificing
information.</p>
<p>Understanding the distribution of p-values can inform the choice of
multiple testing correction methods. For example, if there is an excess
of low p-values, controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) might be
more appropriate than controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER).
After applying a multiple testing correction (such as the
Benjamini-Hochberg method), a p-value histogram of the adjusted p-values
can help evaluate the effectiveness of the correction in controlling
false positives.</p>
<p>Here, we will use our previously generated p-values for each analysed
gene to create a histogram.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/False%20discovery%20rate-rendered-unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>We will also find out how many genes were significantly
differentially expressed between the treated and untreated cells at
α=0.05 before we apply any type 1 error correction method.</p>

</h2>
<p>The Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method is a statistical procedure used to
control the FDR in multiple hypothesis testing, where the chance of
obtaining false positives increases. The BH method helps control the
proportion of false positives (false discoveries) among the rejected
hypotheses, thus providing a more balanced approach than traditional
methods like the <strong>Bonferroni correction</strong>, which can be
overly conservative. The BH procedure adjusts the p-values from multiple
tests to control the FDR. These adjusted p-values can be compared to a
significance threshold to determine which results are significant.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="steps-of-the-benjamini-hochberg-procedure">Steps of the Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#steps-of-the-benjamini-hochberg-procedure"></a>
</h3>
<p>First the observed p-values are arranged in ascending order. Next,
ranks are assigned to the p-values, with the smallest p-value getting
rank 1, the next smallest rank 2, and so on. Then, for each p-value, the
BH critical value is calculated as;</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{BH critical value} = \frac{i}{m}
\times Q\]</span></p>
<p>where, i is the rank, m is the total number of tests, and Q is the
desired FDR level (e.g., 0.05).</p>
<p>After this calculation, the largest p-value that is less than or
equal to its BH critical value is identified. This p-value and all
smaller p-values are considered significant. Optionally, one can adjust
the p-values to reflect the BH correction using software functions.</p>
<p>Now, let us continue with the generated p_values to apply the
Benjamini-Hochberg correction in r, and also plot the adjusted p values
for comparison.</p>
<p>What the Benjamini-Hochberg algorithm does, is that it estimates the
null component, and finds the threshold below which we should reject for
a desired FDR. Equivalently, and that’s the way it’s implemented in R,
we could say it produces adjusted p-values. And if we reject everything
below a certain adjusted p-value (say 5%), this will lead to an FDR of
5%, meaining that 5% of the hits are false-positives.</p>

</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Higher statistical power: FDR control allows for higher power
compared to FWER control. In large-scale genomic studies, this means
detecting more true positives while still controlling false discoveries.
Therefore, since FDR methods are less stringent than FWER methods like
Bonferroni correction, they balance between controlling false
discoveries and maximizing true positives, reducing false
negatives.</p></li>
<li><p>Consistency across studies: By setting a fixed FDR threshold
(e.g., 5%), results are more comparable across different studies and
meta-analyses, enhancing consistency in statistical inference.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that while FDR is preferred in many genomic
screens due to its ability to handle a large number of hypotheses, FWER
control remains appropriate in scenarios where minimizing any false
positives is critical. Each method has its place depending on the
research context and goals.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="what-control-method-should-we-choose">What control method should we choose?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-control-method-should-we-choose"></a>
</h2>
<p>It is essential to understand the difference between controlling the
False Discovery Rate (FDR) and the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER) as each
applies to different research scenarios.</p>
<p>Controlling the FDR is suitable in situations where it is often
acceptable to have some false positives, such as in large-scale
biological screenings (e.g., genomics, proteomics). The goal is to
identify as many true positives as possible, knowing that some false
positives can be filtered out in subsequent validation steps.</p>
<p>On the other hand, controlling FWER is suitable in high-precision
scenarios requiring strict control of false positives. In scenarios
where false positives can have significant consequences (e.g., clinical
trials, diagnostic tests), it is crucial to minimize even a single false
positive. Here, FWER control is more appropriate because it ensures a
lower risk of making any type I error.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important to understand that in exploratory
research, where the aim is to generate hypotheses or discover potential
leads, FDR control is preferred due to its higher power. In confirmatory
research, where results need to be highly reliable, FWER control is more
suitable.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="take-home-message">Take home message<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#take-home-message"></a>
</h3>
<p>While FDR control is widely used in biological research due to its
balance between discovery and false positive control, FWER control is
crucial in settings where the cost of even a single false positive is
high. Each method serves its purpose depending on the specific goals and
acceptable risk levels of the research context. Understanding the
trade-offs between these approaches allows researchers to choose the
most appropriate method for their specific scenario.</p>

<p>Pairwise comparisons are a fundamental concept in statistical
analysis, allowing us to compare the means or proportions of multiple
groups or conditions. In this episode, we will explore the concept of
pairwise comparisons, their importance in statistical testing, and how
they relate to the broader context of multiple testing.</p>

</h2>
<p>In our example of air pollution, fine particulate matter and other
pollutants can induce systemic inflammation in the body, leading to an
increase in circulating inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein
(CRP). Suppose we decide to divide the population into four groups based
on different levels of exposure to air pollution. Lets assume these
groups are as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low exposure: Individuals living in rural areas with minimal
industrial activity and low traffic density.</li>
<li>Moderate exposure: Individuals living in suburban areas with some
industrial activity and moderate traffic density.</li>
<li>High exposure: Individuals living in urban areas with significant
industrial activity and high traffic density.</li>
<li>Very high exposure: Individuals living near industrial zones, major
highways, or heavily polluted urban areas.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Table 2</strong> shows the first six rows of CRP values of
individuals in the four exposure groups.</p>
<table class="table">

<p>In this case the “Exposure” column is a categorical variable with
four groups of exposure levels (Low_exposure, Moderate_exposure,
High_exposure, and Very_high_exposure).</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/Pairwise%20comparisons-rendered-unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Generally, from the above plot, as exposure level increases from low
to very high, we might expect to see a corresponding increase in the
median exposure level and higher median C-reactive protein (CRP)
values.</p>
<p>Our null hypothesis is that there is no difference in CRP amounts in
the different groups. Our significance levels is 0.05.</p>
<p>First we would do ANOVA, which would tell us whether there are any
differences between the groups.</p>

<p>The ANOVA output above, shows statistically significant differences

<p>ANOVA alone does not tell us which specific groups differ
significantly from each other. To determine this, we need to conduct
further analysis. Multiple comparison procedures (also known as post-hoc
tests) are used to compare pairs of groups in order to identify where
the differences lie. These tests provide more detailed information about
which specific group means are different from each other.</p>

<p>Parametric methods, such as ANOVA post-hoc tests (e.g., Tukey’s HSD)
are used when assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance are
met. Non-parametric methods, such as pairwise Wilcoxon tests, are
suitable when data do not meet the assumptions of parametric tests. In
R, performing pairwise comparisons is straightforward using built-in
functions and packages.</p>

<p>We perform a Tukey post-hoc test using <strong>TukeyHSD()</strong> to
determine which specific exposure group means differ significantly from
each other. The results provide pairwise comparisons of group means
along with adjusted p-values to account for multiple comparisons.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="interpreting-pairwise-comparison-results">Interpreting Pairwise Comparison Results<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#interpreting-pairwise-comparison-results"></a>
</h3>
<p>Understanding significance levels and p-values obtained from pairwise
comparisons is essential for interpreting results accurately. The
p-values obtained from pairwise comparisons using the Tukey test are
adjusted to control the familywise error rate (FWER). Adjusted p-values
reflect the probability of observing a given result (or more extreme)
under the assumption that all null hypotheses are true, while accounting
for the number of comparisons made. Here, we interpret pairwise
comparison results with adjusted p-values from the Tukey test by
assessing whether the adjusted p-value is less than the chosen
significance level (α) (0.05). If the adjusted p-value is below the
significance level, we conclude that the observed difference is
statistically significant after correcting for multiple comparisons.</p>
<p>In some research scenarios, the comparisons between groups are
designed to answer specific, pre-defined research questions that are not
directly addressed by traditional ANOVA and subsequent p-value
adjustments. In this case, ANOVA and p-value adjustment don’t make any
sense.</p>
<p>For example, imagine we are conducting a study to investigate the
effect of different types of exercise (A, B, C, D) on three different
health outcomes (X, Y, Z). Our primary interest here is to compare each
type of exercise directly with respect to each health outcome, rather
than comparing all exercises together using ANOVA.</p>
<p>Probable research questions would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does exercise type A have a different effect than exercise type B on
health outcome X?</li>
<li>Is there a difference in the effect of exercise type A compared to
exercise type C on health outcome Y?</li>
<li>How does exercise type D compare to exercise type B in terms of
health outcome Z?</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, instead of conducting a single ANOVA followed by
post-hoc tests to compare all exercises simultaneously, each comparison
is treated as a separate research question. The focus is on comparing
specific pairs of exercise types for each health outcome.</p>
<p>This means that we would analyze each comparison (e.g., A vs B for X,
A vs C for Y, D vs B for Z) independently using appropriate statistical
tests suited for comparing two groups (e.g., t-tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum
tests, etc.). Since these comparisons are independent and are addressing
distinct research questions, there is no need for ANOVA or adjustment of
p-values across comparisons.</p>
<p>We would then interpret the results of each pairwise comparison based
on their individual statistical significance and effect sizes relevant
to the specific research question posed. This approach allows for a
focused investigation into the differences between specific pairs of
exercise types and their effects on different health outcomes. This
tailored approach ensures that the statistical analysis aligns closely
with the specific objectives of the study, providing meaningful insights
into the relationships between variables of interest.</p>

</h2>
<p>Pairwise comparisons involve comparing the means or proportions of
every possible pair of groups or conditions in a dataset. These
comparisons are used to identify specific differences between groups or
conditions that may not be apparent from overall statistical tests (like
the above case ANOVA). These comparisons play a crucial role in
statistical testing, particularly in the context of multiple
comparisons. They allow us to examine specific comparisons of interest
while controlling for the overall familywise error rate. The comparisons
are commonly used in various fields, including medicine, biology, social
sciences, and economics, to compare treatment groups, experimental
conditions, or categorical variables.</p>

</h2>
<p>In the context of the above analysis, data snooping refers to the
practice of exploring the data extensively, testing multiple hypotheses,
and making comparisons until finding a statistically significant result
or an interesting pattern. This can lead to overfitting the data or
finding false positives due to chance alone.</p>
<p>In our example, data snooping could involve testing multiple
comparisons between exposure groups until finding one that appears to be
statistically significant or interesting. For example, one might compare
only the “Very_high_exposure” group with the other groups, ignoring
other potential comparisons. This selective comparison increases the
likelihood of finding a significant result by chance alone.</p>
<p>Additionally, in some cases, we might decide not to perform all
tests. We could just visually inspect our plot, and only perform the
test that seems most promising when comparing the bars by eye. For
example, after observing the initial boxplot, we might want to conduct
numerous additional analyses or subgroup comparisons based on observed
patterns, without pre-specifying these comparisons. This approach can
lead to inflated Type I error rates (false positives) if corrections for
multiple testing are not applied.</p>
<p>Data snooping can influence decision-making by focusing only on
results that appear favorable or intriguing in the data. For instance,
if a particular exposure group shows a larger mean than others, a
decision might be made to focus solely on interventions or policies
targeting that group without considering the broader context or
potential confounding factors.</p>

<h1 id="error-rates">Error rates<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#error-rates"></a>
</h1>
<p>We have seen that when dealing with multiple testing, it is crucial
to understand the different types of error rates that can be controlled.
<strong>Comparison-Wise Error Rate (CWER)</strong>, which is the
probability of making a Type I error (false positive) in any single
hypothesis test, does not account for the multiplicity of tests and can
lead to an increased number of false positives when many tests are
performed. <strong>Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER)</strong>, the
probability of making at least one Type I error among all the hypothesis
tests, is a stringent error rate control method, suitable for situations
where even one false positive is highly problematic. Methods like the
Bonferroni correction and Holm’s are often used to control FWER.
<strong>False Discovery Rate (FDR)</strong>, the expected proportion of
Type I errors among the rejected hypotheses, is less conservative than
FWER and is useful in large-scale testing scenarios, like genomic
studies, where some false positives are tolerable in exchange for higher
power to detect true positives. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure is a
common method to control the FDR.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level1">
<h1 id="choosing-the-appropriate-error-rate">Choosing the appropriate error rate<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#choosing-the-appropriate-error-rate"></a>
</h1>
<p>The choice of error rate to control depends on the research question
and the context of the study. For example, we could choose to control
CWER when testing the efficacy of a single new drug against a placebo in
a clinical trial, or when performing a single regression analysis to
test the relationship between two variables.</p>
<p>One would consider controlling FWER in clinical trials involving
multiple endpoints, where any false positive could lead to incorrect
conclusions about the drug’s safety or efficacy. in addition,
psychological experiments where multiple outcomes are tested and any
false positive could mislead theoretical interpretations would consider
controlling FWER.</p>
<p>The choise for controlling FDR is often considered in genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) analyzing thousands of genetic variants
simultaneously to identify potential associations with a disease, or in
RNA-Seq experiments aiming to identify differentially expressed genes
among tens of thousands of genes.</p>

</h1>
<p>To navigate multiple testing effectively, we should:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>start by <strong>clearly defining our research question</strong>,
stating the specific hypothesis or set of hypotheses we aim to test, and
considering the implications of potential false positives and false
negatives.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, we <strong>decide on the appropriate error rate to
control</strong>, based on our research context and tolerance for Type I
errors. this means assessing how critical it is to avoid any false
positives (favoring FWER) versus allowing some false positives to
increase detection power (favoring FDR).</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, we <strong>select a suitable statistical method that
controls our chosen error rate</strong> and aligns with our data type
and experimental design, ensuring it is well-suited to the specifics of
our study.</p></li>
