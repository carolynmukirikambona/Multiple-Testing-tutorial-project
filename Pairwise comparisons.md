# Pairwise comparisons

Pairwise comparisons are a fundamental concept in statistical analysis, allowing us to compare the means or proportions of multiple groups or conditions. In this tutorial, we will explore the concept of pairwise comparisons, their importance in statistical testing, and how they relate to the broader context of multiple testing.

## Understanding Pairwise Comparisons

Pairwise comparisons involve comparing the means or proportions of every possible pair of groups or conditions in a dataset. These comparisons are used to identify specific differences between groups or conditions that may not be apparent from overall statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA). The comparisons are commonly used in various fields, including medicine, biology, social sciences, and economics, to compare treatment groups, experimental conditions, or categorical variables.

Pairwise comparisons play a crucial role in statistical testing, particularly in the context of multiple comparisons. They allow us to examine specific comparisons of interest while controlling for the overall familywise error rate.

## Methods for Performing Pairwise Comparisons

Parametric methods, such as  ANOVA post-hoc tests (e.g., Tukey's HSD) are used when assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance are met. Non-parametric methods, such as pairwise Wilcoxon tests, are suitable when data do not meet the assumptions of parametric tests.
In R, performing pairwise comparisons is straightforward using built-in functions and packages.

In our example of air pollution, fine particulate matter and other pollutants can induce systemic inflammation in the body, leading to an increase in circulating inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein (CRP). To test the amounts of CRP due to air polution,we decide to divide the population into four groups based on different levels of exposure to air pollution. Lets assume these groups are as follow: 

- Low exposure: Individuals living in rural areas with minimal industrial activity and low traffic density.
- Moderate exposure: Individuals living in suburban areas with some industrial activity and moderate traffic density.
- High exposure: Individuals living in urban areas with significant industrial activity and high traffic density.
- Very high exposure: Individuals living near industrial zones, major highways, or heavily polluted urban areas.

Our null hypothesis is that there is no difference in CRP amounts in the different groups. Our significance levels is 0.05.

Generally, as exposure level increases from low to very high, we might expect to see a corresponding increase in the median exposure level and higher median C-reactive protein (CRP) values.

We perform a Tukey post-hoc test using __TukeyHSD()__ to determine which specific group means differ significantly from each other. The results provide pairwise comparisons of group means along with adjusted p-values to account for multiple comparisons.

## Interpreting Pairwise Comparison Results

Understanding significance levels and p-values obtained from pairwise comparisons is essential for interpreting results accurately. The p-values obtained from pairwise comparisons using the Tukey test are adjusted to control the familywise error rate (FWER) or the false discovery rate (FDR). Adjusted p-values reflect the probability of observing a given result (or more extreme) under the assumption that all null hypotheses are true, while accounting for the number of comparisons made. Here, we interpret pairwise comparison results with adjusted p-values from the Tukey test by assessing whether the adjusted p-value is less than the chosen significance level (Î±) (0.05). If the adjusted p-value is below the significance level, we conclude that the observed difference is statistically significant after correcting for multiple comparisons.

## Data snooping ![Figure_6: Data snooping](fig/Data snooping.png)

In the context of the above analysis, data snooping refers to the practice of exploring the data extensively, testing multiple hypotheses, and making comparisons until finding a statistically significant result or an interesting pattern. This can lead to overfitting the data or finding false positives due to chance alone.

In our example, data snooping could involve testing multiple comparisons between exposure groups until finding one that appears to be statistically significant or interesting. For example, one might compare only the "Very_high_exposure" group with the other groups, ignoring other potential comparisons. This selective comparison increases the likelihood of finding a significant result by chance alone.

After observing the initial boxplot, we might want to conduct numerous additional analyses or subgroup comparisons based on observed patterns, without pre-specifying these comparisons. This approach can lead to inflated Type I error rates (false positives) if corrections for multiple testing are not applied.

Data snooping can influence decision-making by focusing only on results that appear favorable or intriguing in the data. For instance, if a particular exposure group shows a larger mean than others, a decision might be made to focus solely on interventions or policies targeting that group without considering the broader context or potential confounding factors.
